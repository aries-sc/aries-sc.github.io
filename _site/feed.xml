        Aberration is a property of optical systems that results in light being spread out over some region of space rather than focussing on a point. The 
        earth's atmosphere aberrates the wavefronts of the EM waves. Due to this aberration, the images of astronomical objects become distorted. To deal with 
        distortions, and to get high-resolution spectra, different kinds of instruments are used in the field of astronomy. Let us look into some of them in 
        today's talk.
    </p>

    <h5>
       MUSE: 
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        MUSE is an Integral Field Spectrograph working in an optical band. It splits the field of view into 24 image segments of 2.5" each. These segments are 
        further sliced into 48 mini slices. Each set of 48 mini slits is fed into one of the spectrographs to produce a set of spectra.

    <h5>
        History of microwave astronomy:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        It started with the unintentional discovery of <em>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</em> . Wilson and Penzias were trying to make a microwave antenna 
        for Bell labs. However, they detected a leftover microwave signal coming from all directions of the sky, which was nothing but the CMB.

    </figure>

    <h5>
        Instruments to detect CMB:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        The first space-based CMB mission was <em>COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer)</em> satellite. It gave the first full-sky map of CMB, which confirmed Big 
        Bang theory predictions. Nasa launched the <em>Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)</em> in 2001, which revealed that the universe's first stars 
        started shining about 200 million years after the Big Bang. The ESA's Plank space telescope was the latest on the list. CMB measurement needs that 
        noise to be minimal. So, the Planck satellite had an inbuilt system to keep itself cool, and it was sent at the cold L2 point. It had two scientific
        instruments: the <em>High-Frequency Instrument (HFI)</em> and the <em>Low-Frequency Instrument (LFI)</em>.
    </p>

    <h5>
        HIRES:
    </h5>
    <p class="post">
        The <em>High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer</em> at the Keck's Observatory, Hawai, works in the optical band of em spectra. It has three arms, R, G 
        and B. It helps to break up the incoming light into its different colours to measure the intensity of each colour precisely.
    </p>


    <h5>
        Adaptive Optics:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        Take the case of an incoming ray of light coming through the atmosphere. Water droplets distort the wavefronts of the waves in the atmosphere, which 
        work as air lenses. So, the wavefront captured by the instrument is aberrated and tilted. Tip-tilt correction is done on the wavefront to account 
        for the tilt. A deformable mirror is used to account for the aberration. It takes the complementary shape of the wavefront using control electronics 
        so that the actual wavefront can be obtained as output.
        <ul class="post">
            <li>
                In the case of <em>Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO)</em>, one guide star (should be present in the same sky patch where we are taking 
                the observation) is used to get the measurement of the wavefront phase, assuming that both the objects face the same amount of aberration.
            </li>
            <li>In the case of <em>Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics (LTAO)</em>, laser beacons are used in the field of view to work as guide stars.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO)</em> is a technique in which several wavefront sensors control one deformable mirror. The guide sources are 
                distributed in a large field of view.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO)</em> uses multiple guide stars, including natural and Laser stars, several wavefront sensors, and 
                many deformable mirrors.

            There has been a massive growth in the availability of Astrophysical data in recent years. This growth is going to increase in the future with the 
            advent of newer telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope now known as the Vera Rubin Telescope, and the 
            Dark energy survey Instrument DESI. This, combined with the existing telescopes, provides a plethora of opportunities to employ ML to solve 
            astrophysical problems. In this talk, I introduce ML in astrophysics and discuss a test case of classifying variable stars using the K nearest 
            neighbor technique in anticipation that the talk will encourage peers to explore astrophysical data sets and appreciate the power and nuances 
            related to algorithms and big data in astrophysics.
        </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p class="post">
        In this talk, we are taken through the journey of basic Machine Learning algorithms and their application towards analysing the enormous chunks of 
        data generated in Astrophysical observations. The speaker also demonstrates the same with a test case he worked on during his Master's project.
   </p>

   <p class="post">
        Times are changing, and gone are the days when we used to think that 1 GB of data was huge. Today, astronomical observations yield Peta-bytes of Data! 
        Earlier, the data was manageable as per human limitations. However, going forward, analysis of big data cannot be achieved using our trivial ways. This 
        is so because there are a limited number of scientists, astronomers, and analysts, but there is no limit to the data we generate daily. The data will 
        keep piling up, and one day we might even run out of storage space.
   </p>

   <p class="post">
        How to tackle this problem? Citizen Science comes to the rescue. We increase the number of people by training the common people (who may not be 
        specialised in Astronomy and Astrophysicists), called Citizen Scientists. One great example of this is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite 
        (TESS), where Citizen Scientists are trained to label the light curves of the transiting exoplanet. If there is a dip in the light curve, it can be 
        considered an exoplanet. Depending on the dip's period, width, and duration, the exoplanets are further matched with a template to classify the type 
        of exoplanet. The authorship is also shared with the citizen. In Pune, India, we also have such a program named the Pune Knowledge Cluster (PKC), which
        IUCAA and other institutes in Pune operate. They label and categorise the galaxies.

   <p class="post">
        Furthermore, to facilitate these initiatives and make the process faster and more efficient, we finally apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques. 
        Classifying our data using ML has a few basic steps, as follows:
        <ol class="post">
            <li>Importing the Data</li>
            <li>Organise and Preprocess the data- The data should be uniform, i.e., the sampling rate, resolution, and processing should be similar.</li>
            <li>Explore Data and Engineer the features - The features that distinguish one type from the other.</li>
            <li>Build a model - The model should be able to take into account all the features and summarise it so that we can distinguish different 
                types/classes of objects.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the model - The precision of the data is verified using a confusion chart.</li>
            <li>Finally, deploy the model for use.</li>
        </ol>
   </p>

   <p class="post">
        For example, if we want our model to recognise the difference between the letters' J' and 'M', we must first consider how our mind differentiates 
        between the two. We can evaluate the X and Y-axis of the stroke and the time for each stroke. 'J' has a single minima, whereas 'M' has three minimas 
        with an oscillation pattern. On the other hand, 'J' is written quicker than 'M'. Now that we have our features and model, we must test its accuracy 
        using Confusion Charts. In this chart, we draw a matrix comparing the expected vs. the predicted outcomes. If the desired outcome is achieved, we 
        deploy the model to the end user; otherwise, the model is further modified to correct the confusion chart results. It is somewhat like how a child 
        learns to recognise the number '10'. The speaker demonstrates that, in his attempt to classify the letters 'J', 'M', and 'V' using three features, he 
        got an accuracy of 80% and a misclassification of 20%. If the number of features increases, the accuracy also increases. For more features, we need 
        more data.
   </p>

   <p class="post">
        The speaker used a similar kind of approach to classify about 100,000 variable stars. Using features such as the light curve analysis, HR Diagram, 
        Blazkho effect (change of amplitude in different cycles with the same period), binary light curve, distance, entropy (the scatter of the distribution 
        in magnitude) etc., he could classify different variable stars as Cepheids, RR Lyrae, Delta-Scuti and others.
   </p>

   <p class="post">
        We can simplify ML as a mathematical function. The complete system of input and output of that function, including all the other hidden layers, is 
        called a Neural Network. It is named so since it mimics the neurons of the brain. We give different weightage to different features depending upon 
        their importance to classify an object type, and the sum total threshold decides the object's class.
   </p>

   </figure>

   <p class="post">
        To summarise, in these modern times, Big Data is inevitable, and ML is a necessary boon to tackle the same. Astrophysics is one such field that must 
        take complete advantage of various ML techniques. The best part of ML is that a combination of some random features yields fruitful results, and we do 
        not know why. This also gives us a deeper insight into how things work in the Universe. ML techniques are fast and efficient, and they can analyse 
        astronomical observations with a speed of thousands of observations per second (or even more). ML is the way to the future for Astrophysical studies.

            Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most energetic and luminous events in the universe. These powerful explosions can last from milliseconds to 
            minutes, and they can be hundreds of times brighter than a typical supernova and a million trillion times brighter than the Sun. Despite their 
            discovery decades ago, we still do not fully understand the origins and causes of GRBs. One of the main challenges in studying GRBs is their 
            classification. To unravel this mystery, various classification schemes have been proposed based on different characteristics of the bursts, such 
            as duration, hardness, and spectral properties. Join me as we delve into this problem and explore the latest advancements in solving it.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="post">
        The talk started with what GRBs are, how we detect them, and why these areas of astrophysics are full of excitement. GRB is the Burst of gamma rays. 
        “Burst” means a sudden release of emission that lasts from milliseconds to thousands of seconds, and the term gamma is related to the energy of bursts 
        ranging from 100 KeV to 1 MeV. GRBs are the most luminous event since the BIG Bang. Typically &#947-ray luminosity is ~10<sup>51</sup> - 
        10<sup>53</sup>  erg s<sup>-1</sup>. This is more than the total energy the Sun releases in its entire lifetime. We can also compare the luminosity of 
        other objects in the Universe. For example, the luminosity of the Sun is ~10 <sup>33</sup>  erg s <sup>-1</sup> , and the total star-light luminosity 
        of the Milky Way Galaxy is ~10 <sup>44</sup>erg s <sup>-1</sup>. Even the most energetic Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) powered by accreting super-massive black holes only 
        have a luminosity of ~10 <sup>48</sup>  erg s <sup>-1</sup>.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="post">How was it Discovered - It was an accident!</h5>
    <p class="post">
        In 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan were severely destroyed by atomic bombs released by the United States. After this event, nuclear tests were 
        banned all over World. United States launched a series of satellites to monitor compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed by the United 
        States. The discovery of the first GRBs was made in the late 1960s by the military satellite system Vela. Since nuclear energy lies in the gamma 
        frequency range, they discovered some intense flashes, which was a mystery for a long time. Later, from redshift, they concluded that it was 
        extragalactic.
    </p>

    <h5 class="post"> Types of GRBs</h5>
    <p class="post">
        Based on T90 (the duration during which the triggering detector detects 5 % to 95 % of the total fluence), there are two types of GRB.
        <ul class="post">
            <li>Short GRB (T90 < 2 sec) </li>
            <li>Long GRB (T90 > 2 sec)</li>
        </ul>
        Long GRBs are believed to be associated with the death of some special massive star (Supernova and kilonova). In contrast, short GRBs are associated 
        with the merger of compact objects such as Neutron Star-Neutron Star or Neutron Star-Black Hole merger.
    </p>

    <h5 class="post">Why do we need other ways to classify GRB ?</h5>
    <p class="post">
        Since the definition of T90 depends on the energy band and sensitivity of the detector. The same burst may have a longer T90 if the detector is more 
        sensitive or has a softer energy band. Also, the background fluctuations play the villain.
    </p>

    <h5 class="post">What are the other ways ?</h5>
    <p class="post">
        There are two phases in which we observe GRB - one being the Prompt Emission Phase and another being the Afterglow Phase.
    </p>
    <p class="post">
        To point out, we can classify GRBs using the following features:
        <ul class="post">
            <li>Hardness Ratio</li>
            <li>Minimum Variability time scale</li>
            <li>Spectral Lag</li>
            <li>Position in Amati Plane</li>
            <li>Host Properties</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h5 class="post">How do we come to know when a GRB takes place? How to detect them?</h5>
    <p class="post">
        We use the Gamma-Ray Coordinate Network, which uses a network of various space-based telescopes such as Fermi and Swift. This network notifies us 
        whenever such a phenomenon takes place. Once notified, we point our optical telescopes in the appropriate direction.

            In the talk, I will briefly start with different behaviors that may appear in and the different samplings of the lightcurves along with the issue 
            to be wary of, while flux to magnitude conversion. The talk will be mainly oriented to periodic search in the lightcurve. The two types of Fourier 
            transforms along with the utility of one over the other will be discussed. I will present some real lightcurves, their temporal analyses that are 
            directly implicated to the topics covered and discuss various properties of a periodogram with the dependence of their peak significance onto 
            their normalizations. A brief disclosure of convolution and its versatility over binning will be discussed as well and if time permits I will also 
            go over Wavelet analysis and its superiority over periodograms.

        This talk will mainly focus on the mathematical aspects of various techniques used to analyze the light curve of the observed data. Light curves are 
        plots showing the variation in brightness or flux of an object over time. This is an essential tool in observational astronomy.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        There are mainly two types of sampling of lightcurve, even and uneven. Mixtures of even and uneven samplings (irrespective of the analysis) should be 
        such that our analysis handles both types of samplings. Any periodic variation may not persist for long due to highly unpredictable behaviour.

        Here, "B" is quite important, as it is one of the roots to form periodogram statistics like individual peak significance and global FAP levels. We can 
        also consider it as a normalization constant for statistical balance. Periodograms also solve the problem of discreteness of our usual Fourier 
        transform method. However, we have an additional issue of even and uneven sampling! This is solved using the Lomb Scargle Periodogram (LSP), where the 
        periodogram is written in sine and cosine terms. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a well-known algorithm for detecting and characterizing periodic 
        signals in unevenly-sampled data. If the Relative change in frequency is constant, they appear equidistant in log space. Hence, it is better for 
        harmonic search because they will be evenly separated.

        Furthermore, the talk continues by discussing the technique of <em>Convolution</em>. Convolution amounts to sliding one function past the other, 
        integrating at each step. Such an operation is commonly used in smoothing a function. It is more versatile than binning (taking average), and binning 
        is a particular case of smoothing through convolution.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        $$ (f * g)(t) \approx \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)g(t-\tau) d\tau $$
    </p>

    <p class="post">  
        <ul class="post">
            <li>If g(x) = Probability Distribution Function such that &#8747 g(x).dx = 1, then convolution becomes a moving average with the desired PDF.</li>
            <li>If g(x) is a rectangular wave function with length N and height 1/N, then the convolution becomes averaging over N data points with equal 
                weightage.</li>
            <li>With proper arbitrary g(x), small, medium and large variations or even flares could be smoothed.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        Mathematically, the fact of the invertibility of the convolution mapping (one-to-one) implies that the information content of the convolution is 
        identical to the information content of the original image. Convolution decreases the white noise and does not affect the low-frequency region but the 
        high-frequency region because fluctuations are observed in high-frequency regions. At the same time, the binning (onto, not one-to-one) contains less 
        information and reduces power.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        If we combine LSP and Convolution properties, we get some additional benefits, for example, if there are any gaps in our observed data, then LSP 
        combined convolution takes care of it.

        <ul class="post">
            A few take-home points from the talk:
            <li>There happens to be a true hidden power spectrum over which the periodogram is distributed in a chi-square fashion with two degrees of 
                freedom.</li>
            <li>The noise reduction in the high-frequency regime before the Nyquist frequency is still unexplored.</li>
            <li>The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram cannot tell the time of inset or disappearance of any significant peak.</li>
            <li>The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram cannot assess the time evolution of an already existing significant peak.</li>
            <li>The Wavelet analysis is capable of handling the last two inefficacy of LSP.</li>

        <p class="post"> Active galaxies are highly luminous astrophysical sources in the universe powered by “supermassive black holes” via processes known 
            as “accretion”. They contain a highly bright, compact region at the galaxy’s center called “active galactic nuclei” (AGN). Their emission spreads 
            over a wide range of frequencies through radio to γ-rays. Both thermal and non-thermal radiations from different components of AGN contribute to 
            the total observed emission. They exhibit extreme variations ranging from all the time-scale from minutes to years across the electromagnetic band.
            These variations occur as flares or quiescent/low-activity states. Studying the cause for such physical properties of AGNs through multi-frequency 
            data using ground and space-based observatories has been found to be one of the most effective ways in the past. Despite such studies in various 
            wavebands, there are several questions for which answers are not fully understood. In this talk, the speaker will briefly introduce AGN and its 
            current understanding status, along with the scope of AGN research.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="post">We present to you the second talk of our ARIES Science Club by Dr. Krishna Mohana. On our Earth, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) generates 
        particles with energies in the Tera electron volts (TeV) range, which is a lot! However, there are some mysterious and powerful objects in our Universe
        where this energy is just child's play. They are called AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei).
    </p>

    <p class="post">An AGN is a small region at the center of some galaxies that is far brighter than can be explained by the stellar population alone. AGNs 
        emit radiation from radio waves to gamma rays across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Carl Seyfert discovered this incredible phenomenon in 1943. 
        The galaxies which contain these AGNs were thus named Seyfert Galaxies.
    </p>

        <figcaption class="post-caption">Figure 1: Unified model of AGN</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The AGN structure has certain key components:
        <ul class="post">
            <li>The central engine (supermassive black hole mass ~10<sup>8</sup> - 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>&#9737</sub>)</li>
            <li>Accretion disk</li>
            <li>Corona</li>
            <li>Broad line region</li>
            <li>Narrow line region</li>
            <li>Dusty torus</li>
            <li>Relativistic jets</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="post">Further, AGNs are classified in terms of the observer's viewing angle, the energy of the jets, and the width of the emission line. The 
        picture below depicts the various classifications:
    </p>

    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/2023-02-10-talk/figure2.jpg" alt="classifications of AGN">
        <figcaption class="post-caption">Figure 2: Classifications of AGNs</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="post">Another interesting consequence of AGN jets is Superluminal motion, which occurs when an emission region moves at a velocity close to the 
        speed of light along a direction that forms a small angle with the observer's line of sight. The time interval between the emission of two successive 
        photons, as measured in the observer's frame, is reduced & the source appears to move faster than its actual velocity.
    </p>

    <p class="post">Interestingly, in 1959, a star-like object was discovered in radio band. An optical starlight source was observed in the same region with 
        unusual properties, such as emission lines. These were termed quasi-stellar radio sources (in short, Quasars) because the nature of these objects is 
        entirely unknown. It is hard to prepare a short and appropriate nomenclature for them so that their essential properties are obvious from their name.
        Quasars, also a type of AGN, are the most luminous objects in our Universe, powered by supermassive black holes which are a billion times more massive
        than our Sun.
    </p>

    <p class="post">We can detect AGNs through multi-messenger astronomy (gamma-rays through radio waves, jets) and polarization. Polarization observation of 
        AGN jets provides valuableinformation about their magnetic field. Due to the magnetic field's twisting, we can observe the frame-dragging effect of a 
        spinning black hole and the differential rotation of the accretion disk
    </p>

    <p class="post">A few ground and space observatories to detect the AGN mechanisms are: EGRET(Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope), FGST (Fermi 
        Gamma-ray Space Telescope), SWIFT, India's AstroSAT, our ARIES's very own DOT 3.6m (Devesthal Optical Telescope). 
    </p>

    <p class="post">Through studying AGN, we can enhance our understanding of the origin of jets, emission mechanism, accretion disk, supermassive blackhole, 
        extragalactic sources, and early Universe, and hence, test the general theory of relativity.
    </p>

    <p class="post">Some of the numerous open questions in this field?
        <ul class="post">
            <li>Where along the jet, do the high-energy and very high-energy y-ray emissions
                predominantly originate?
            </li>
            <li>Whether the high energy emission mechanism is leptonic, hadronic, or mixed?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="post"> Welcome to the first talk organized by the ARIES Science Club! Vivek Kr. Jha presented the first talk. He is also the mentor of our ARIES
        Science Club (ASC).The talk started with a basic introduction to telescopes. There are various types of telescopes depending on the wavelength we want
        to observe and the resolution that can be achieved. For example, optical and Radio waves can be observed from ground-based telescopes, whereas the same
        is not feasible for infrared, UV, and X-ray wavebands. To tackle that, we send the telescopes to specific points in higher atmosphere or space. Also,
        we have telescopes of different sizes and arrangements with different resolutions and use cases. For example, radio observations need a very large 
        aperture of the telescope, which is very difficult to make with a single disc antenna. For that array of small antennas is installed in a large open 
        area.

     <p class="post">The speaker takes everyone through the journey of the capabilities of different telescopes, mainly those with a size greater than 8 meters.
        To list a few:
        <ul class="post">
            <li><em>South African Large Telescope (SALT)</em>: This is the largest single optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. However, it has a major 
                drawback. It cannot be steered to change the angle of the telescope, hence limiting the observations to a relatively small ring of the sky.
            </li>
            <li><em>Very Large Telescope (VLT)</em>: With its set of four 8.2 meter telescopes, it is one of the most technologically advanced telescope 
                systems due to its ability to perform interferometry using its built-in MUSE equipment. In interferometry, we divide a wide field of view 
                (large fringe) into smaller slits and then record their interference fringes created by combining the light from multiple telescopes. For 
                example, our galaxy is quite wide apart and needs multiple slits to cover its boundaries.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="post">Next the speaker talks about Radio telescopes a little bit. Optical wavebands are limited, but Radio has a large bandpass. Also, radio 
        observations can be taken in the daytime, unlike optical. The most advanced telescope for Radio observation is <em>VLA</em> in US and <em>ALMA</em> in 
        Europe. ALMA is the costliest ground-based telescope to be built to date, with 66 radio antennas in operation. The <em>Five hundred meter Aperture 
        Spherical Telescope (FAST)</em> in Guizhou, China, is the world’s largest field-aperture telescope. It works in the radio band 70 MHz- 3.0 GHz. India 
        has its own telescopes for radio observation. The <em>Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT)</em> in Pune is the largest radio telescope in India. The
        main goal of this telescope was to observe the 21 cm line of the neutral Hydrogen. The USPs of this telescope are the 153 and 325 MHz frequencies, 
        which are critical in Radio astronomy.
    </p> 

    <p class="post">Other than optical and Radio telescopes, we also have UV and X-ray telescopes in space. The most popular globally is the 32 years old 
        <em>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</em>, which has made fundamental contributions to the field. India’s <em>AstroSat</em>, launched in 2015, can also 
        detect X-ray polarization, a unique attribute of this telescope. Now, modern-day astronomy is progressing from multi-wavelength to multi-messenger 
        observation. By multi-messenger observation, it is implied that we are also looking for messengers other than photons, like neutrinos, cosmic rays, 
        and gravitational waves.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        A few take-home points from this lecture:
        <ul class="post">
            <li>Telescopes have increased in size over time, and the trend will continue in the coming future.</li>
            <li>A vast number of telescopes are coming up both on Earth and in space.</li>
            <li>They continue to expand our knowledge further, probing the Universe closer and closer to the Big Bang.</li>
            <li>Multi-messenger astronomy is the new norm, as has been with GW detection recently.</li>
            <li>India is part of a handful of major projects like SKA, TMT, and GMRT, with a possibility of a 10-meter class telescope in the future.</li>
        </ul>
