        <p class="post">
            Coronal heating is a problem that has puzzled scientists for decades. One proposed mechanism for coronal heating is the energy transfer in the 
            solar corona by Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Several types of MHD waves can be observed in the solar corona, and kink oscillations are a 
            ubiquitous manifestation of largely transverse MHD waves in the solar corona. In this talk, I'll touch upon the historical and introductory 
            aspects of coronal heating, shedding light on the observational perspective. Furthermore, we'll explore the intriguing topic of kink oscillations 
            and their related heating phenomena within the context of the most recent and cutting-edge imaging instruments.

        What is the Solar Corona?
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        The Sun is surrounded by an atmosphere of gasses, and the Corona is the outermost layer. The Corona has a temperature of 3-4 orders of magnitude 
        greater than the visible surface (greater than a million degrees). Due to the relative brightness of the Sun's surface, it is only visible from Earth 
        during total solar eclipses.

        What is the problem of Coronal heating?
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <em>"For decades, the problem has been known as the coronal heating problem, but it is now clear that coronal heating cannot be treated or explained 
            in isolation and that the heating of the whole solar atmosphere must be studied as a highly coupled system. The magnetic field of the Sun is known 
            to play a key role....</em>

    <p class="post">
        <em>....the question of which mechanism or mechanisms are the dominant supplier of energy to the chromosphere and Corona is still open."</em>

    </p>

    <p class="post">
        In the 1890s, the solar surface temperature was derived to be around 6600K, using the newly-discovered Stefan-Boltzmann law. The solar photosphere 
        radiates like a blackbody; its spectrum gives T, and dark "Fraunhofer lines" reveal its chemical composition. However, during the 1870s total solar 
        eclipse revealed a complex outer solar corona. Spectrographs revealed unknown bright lines along with Fraunhofer lines.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        A strange emission line was observed in the green part of the spectrum. This emission line was thought to be due to a new and unknown element, and it 
        was named Coronium. Later scientists found that there is no new element and emission is coming from highly ionized atoms. Similarly, other unknown lines were identified as CaXII, FeIX, to FeXII. However, to ionise these elements to such a great extent 
        requires a very high temperature. Hence, it was calculated that the Corona must have temperatures greater than 1 million K. And so the coronal heating 
        problem began.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        What was strange was that, as we go higher up in the solar atmosphere, the temperature should decrease since plasma density decreases drastically. 
        However, it was not the case.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        Solar physicists have proposed two probable mechanisms for coronal heating.
        <ol class="post">
            <li><strong>Nano-Flare heating:</strong> In this theory, the Corona is heated by very small flares(nano-flares) being the energy source, which 
                could be detected through conventional telescopes.</li>
            <li><strong>Wave-Heating:</strong> In this theory, a countless number of magnetic field lines extending from the surface of the Sun are oscillated 
                by the dynamics of the convection on the solar surface, which delivers the energy to the Corona. The energy is then converted into heat in the 
                Corona.</li>
        </ol>
        Which of these is most important for chromospheric and coronal heating is still very much an open question.

        Kink oscillations of coronal loops
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        Kink oscillations are the transverse displacement of the loop axis.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        These oscillations are fundamental modes of coronal loops, with their nodes at the photosphere, i.e. the perturbation at the photosphere is zero. The 
        coronal mass ejections power the kink oscillations.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        There are two different regimes of kink oscillations based on the evolution of their amplitude.
        <ol class="post">
            <li><strong>Decaying-</strong> The oscillations decay in amplitude with time.</li>
            <li><strong>Decayless:</strong> The oscillations do not decay even for a few hours. They have a lower amplitude than the decaying oscillations, and 
                hence they have lower energy.</li>
        </ol>
        Earlier studies predicted that the decayless kink oscillations were powerful enough to power the heating of the Corona. However SDO/AIA observations 
        showed that transverse oscillations in polar plumes have energy flux 4-10 times below than the required.

        The new era of high-resolution imaging: Solar Orbiter/EUI
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        The newly launched Solar Orbiter and EUI are state-of-the-art facilities capable of imaging the solar atmosphere at very high resolutions. The Solar 
        orbiter, at an impressive distance of 0.28 AU from the Sun, can take clear images of the solar atmosphere. Furthermore, unlike any other telescope, it 
        can have a cadence of 2-3 seconds.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
        Lastly, it is noteworthy to add that the in-house team comprising Purvi Udhwani, Arpit Shrivastav from ARIES, along with Dr. Ritesh Patel are developing 
        a tool called 'SITCoM: SiRGraF Integrated Tool for Cronal dynaMics', which will aid them in understanding the dynamics of the Solar Corona.
