        <p class="post">
            In the talk, I will briefly start with different behaviors that may appear in and the different samplings of the lightcurves along with the issue 
            to be wary of, while flux to magnitude conversion. The talk will be mainly oriented to periodic search in the lightcurve. The two types of Fourier 
            transforms along with the utility of one over the other will be discussed. I will present some real lightcurves, their temporal analyses that are 
            directly implicated to the topics covered and discuss various properties of a periodogram with the dependence of their peak significance onto 
            their normalizations. A brief disclosure of convolution and its versatility over binning will be discussed as well and if time permits I will also 
            go over Wavelet analysis and its superiority over periodograms.

        This talk will mainly focus on the mathematical aspects of various techniques used to analyze the light curve of the observed data. Light curves are 
        plots showing the variation in brightness or flux of an object over time. This is an essential tool in observational astronomy.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are mainly two types of sampling of lightcurve, even and uneven. Mixtures of even and uneven samplings (irrespective of the analysis) should be 
        such that our analysis handles both types of samplings. Any periodic variation may not persist for long due to highly unpredictable behaviour.

        Furthermore, we use Periodograms to determine the periodicity of an object from the light curve. The periodogram is represented by:

    <p>
        &#936<sub>1</sub>(&#937) and &#936 <sub>2</sub>(&#937) are real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of any time-varying function, where &#937 
        is the frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, "B" is quite important, as it is one of the roots to form periodogram statistics like individual peak significance and global FAP levels. We can 
        also consider it as a normalization constant for statistical balance. Periodograms also solve the problem of discreteness of our usual Fourier 
        transform method. However, we have an additional issue of even and uneven sampling! This is solved using the Lomb Scargle Periodogram (LSP), where the 
        periodogram is written in sine and cosine terms. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a well-known algorithm for detecting and characterizing periodic 
        signals in unevenly-sampled data. If the Relative change in frequency is constant, they appear equidistant in log space. Hence, it is better for 
        harmonic search because they will be evenly separated.

        Furthermore, the talk continues by discussing the technique of <em>Convolution</em>. Convolution amounts to sliding one function past the other, 
        integrating at each step. Such an operation is commonly used in smoothing a function. It is more versatile than binning (taking average), and binning 
        is a particular case of smoothing through convolution.
