            In the talk, I will briefly start with different behaviors that may appear in and the different samplings of the lightcurves along with the issue 
            to be wary of, while flux to magnitude conversion. The talk will be mainly oriented to periodic search in the lightcurve. The two types of Fourier 
            transforms along with the utility of one over the other will be discussed. I will present some real lightcurves, their temporal analyses that are 
            directly implicated to the topics covered and discuss various properties of a periodogram with the dependence of their peak significance onto 
            their normalizations. A brief disclosure of convolution and its versatility over binning will be discussed as well and if time permits I will also 
            go over Wavelet analysis and its superiority over periodograms.

        This talk will mainly focus on the mathematical aspects of various techniques used to analyze the light curve of the observed data. Light curves are 
        plots showing the variation in brightness or flux of an object over time. This is an essential tool in observational astronomy.

        There are mainly two types of sampling of lightcurve, even and uneven. Mixtures of even and uneven samplings (irrespective of the analysis) should be 
        such that our analysis handles both types of samplings. Any periodic variation may not persist for long due to highly unpredictable behaviour.

        Furthermore, we use Periodograms to determine the periodicity of an object from the light curve. The periodogram is represented by:
