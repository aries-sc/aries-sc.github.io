            Instruments are the hidden figures of every world, especially astronomy and we need to give them the attention they deserve! In this talk I will 
            attempt to cover the basics of instruments, both ground and space based, used in astronomy all over the world and how they give us the data we use 
            for our research.

        Aberration is a property of optical systems that results in light being spread out over some region of space rather than focussing on a point. The 
        earth's atmosphere aberrates the wavefronts of the EM waves. Due to this aberration, the images of astronomical objects become distorted. To deal with 
        distortions, and to get high-resolution spectra, different kinds of instruments are used in the field of astronomy. Let us look into some of them in 
        today's talk.

    <h5>
       MUSE: 
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        MUSE is an Integral Field Spectrograph working in an optical band. It splits the field of view into 24 image segments of 2.5" each. These segments are 
        further sliced into 48 mini slices. Each set of 48 mini slits is fed into one of the spectrographs to produce a set of spectra.

        History of microwave astronomy:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        It started with the unintentional discovery of <em>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</em> . Wilson and Penzias were trying to make a microwave antenna 
        for Bell labs. However, they detected a leftover microwave signal coming from all directions of the sky, which was nothing but the CMB.

        Instruments to detect CMB:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        The first space-based CMB mission was <em>COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer)</em> satellite. It gave the first full-sky map of CMB, which confirmed Big 
        Bang theory predictions. Nasa launched the <em>Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)</em> in 2001, which revealed that the universe's first stars 
        started shining about 200 million years after the Big Bang. The ESA's Plank space telescope was the latest on the list. CMB measurement needs that 
        noise to be minimal. So, the Planck satellite had an inbuilt system to keep itself cool, and it was sent at the cold L2 point. It had two scientific
        instruments: the <em>High-Frequency Instrument (HFI)</em> and the <em>Low-Frequency Instrument (LFI)</em>.

    <h5>
        HIRES:
    </h5>
    <p class="post">
        The <em>High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer</em> at the Keck's Observatory, Hawai, works in the optical band of em spectra. It has three arms, R, G 
        and B. It helps to break up the incoming light into its different colours to measure the intensity of each colour precisely.

    <h5>
        Adaptive Optics:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        Take the case of an incoming ray of light coming through the atmosphere. Water droplets distort the wavefronts of the waves in the atmosphere, which 
        work as air lenses. So, the wavefront captured by the instrument is aberrated and tilted. Tip-tilt correction is done on the wavefront to account 
        for the tilt. A deformable mirror is used to account for the aberration. It takes the complementary shape of the wavefront using control electronics 
        so that the actual wavefront can be obtained as output.
        <ul class="post">
            <li>
                In the case of <em>Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO)</em>, one guide star (should be present in the same sky patch where we are taking 
                the observation) is used to get the measurement of the wavefront phase, assuming that both the objects face the same amount of aberration.
            </li>
            <li>In the case of <em>Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics (LTAO)</em>, laser beacons are used in the field of view to work as guide stars.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO)</em> is a technique in which several wavefront sensors control one deformable mirror. The guide sources are 
                distributed in a large field of view.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO)</em> uses multiple guide stars, including natural and Laser stars, several wavefront sensors, and 
                many deformable mirrors.
