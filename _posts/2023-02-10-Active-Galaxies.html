    <blockquote>
        <p class="post"> Active galaxies are highly luminous astrophysical sources in the universe powered by “supermassive black holes” via processes known 
            as “accretion”. They contain a highly bright, compact region at the galaxy’s center called “active galactic nuclei” (AGN). Their emission spreads 
            over a wide range of frequencies through radio to γ-rays. Both thermal and non-thermal radiations from different components of AGN contribute to 
            the total observed emission. They exhibit extreme variations ranging from all the time-scale from minutes to years across the electromagnetic band.
            These variations occur as flares or quiescent/low-activity states. Studying the cause for such physical properties of AGNs through multi-frequency 
            data using ground and space-based observatories has been found to be one of the most effective ways in the past. Despite such studies in various 
            wavebands, there are several questions for which answers are not fully understood. In this talk, the speaker will briefly introduce AGN and its 
            current understanding status, along with the scope of AGN research.</p>

    <p class="post">We present to you the second talk of our ARIES Science Club by Dr. Krishna Mohana. On our Earth, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) generates 
        particles with energies in the Tera electron volts (TeV) range, which is a lot! However, there are some mysterious and powerful objects in our Universe
        where this energy is just child's play. They are called AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei).
    </p>

    <p class="post">An AGN is a small region at the center of some galaxies that is far brighter than can be explained by the stellar population alone. AGNs 
        emit radiation from radio waves to gamma rays across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Carl Seyfert discovered this incredible phenomenon in 1943. 
        The galaxies which contain these AGNs were thus named Seyfert Galaxies.

    <p>The AGN structure has certain key components:
        <ul class="post">
            <li>The central engine (supermassive black hole mass ~10<sup>8</sup> - 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>&#9737</sub>)</li>
            <li>Accretion disk</li>
            <li>Corona</li>
            <li>Broad line region</li>
            <li>Narrow line region</li>
            <li>Dusty torus</li>
            <li>Relativistic jets</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="post">Further, AGNs are classified in terms of the observer's viewing angle, the energy of the jets, and the width of the emission line. The 
        picture below depicts the various classifications:

    <p class="post">Another interesting consequence of AGN jets is Superluminal motion, which occurs when an emission region moves at a velocity close to the 
        speed of light along a direction that forms a small angle with the observer's line of sight. The time interval between the emission of two successive 
        photons, as measured in the observer's frame, is reduced & the source appears to move faster than its actual velocity.
    </p>

    <p class="post">Interestingly, in 1959, a star-like object was discovered in radio band. An optical starlight source was observed in the same region with 
        unusual properties, such as emission lines. These were termed quasi-stellar radio sources (in short, Quasars) because the nature of these objects is 
        entirely unknown. It is hard to prepare a short and appropriate nomenclature for them so that their essential properties are obvious from their name.
        Quasars, also a type of AGN, are the most luminous objects in our Universe, powered by supermassive black holes which are a billion times more massive
        than our Sun.
    </p>

    <p class="post">We can detect AGNs through multi-messenger astronomy (gamma-rays through radio waves, jets) and polarization. Polarization observation of 
        AGN jets provides valuableinformation about their magnetic field. Due to the magnetic field's twisting, we can observe the frame-dragging effect of a 
        spinning black hole and the differential rotation of the accretion disk
    </p>

    <p class="post">A few ground and space observatories to detect the AGN mechanisms are: EGRET(Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope), FGST (Fermi 
        Gamma-ray Space Telescope), SWIFT, India's AstroSAT, our ARIES's very own DOT 3.6m (Devesthal Optical Telescope). 
    </p>

    <p class="post">Through studying AGN, we can enhance our understanding of the origin of jets, emission mechanism, accretion disk, supermassive blackhole, 
        extragalactic sources, and early Universe, and hence, test the general theory of relativity.
    </p>

    <p class="post">Some of the numerous open questions in this field?
        <ul class="post">
            <li>Where along the jet, do the high-energy and very high-energy y-ray emissions
                predominantly originate?
            </li>
            <li>Whether the high energy emission mechanism is leptonic, hadronic, or mixed?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
