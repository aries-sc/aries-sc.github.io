        <p class="post">The multi-wavelength and multi-messenger information received from the cosmic objects serves as a laboratory for astronomers to 
            understand the universe. With technology progressing at a rapid rate, how can astronomy lag behind? Already, there are multiple telescopes with
            apertures of 10-meter class and networks of telescopes operating across the globe, along with many multi-wavelength telescopes orbiting the earth.
            Data obtained from these telescopes have revolutionezed our understanding in the recent past. As a natural progression, the era of next-generation 
            telescopes started with the JWST launch last year. With multiple exciting projects lined up this decade, we can expect to get many new results with
            better data and enhanced precision.

    <p class="post"> Welcome to the first talk organized by the ARIES Science Club! Vivek Kr. Jha presented the first talk. He is also the mentor of our ARIES
        Science Club (ASC).The talk started with a basic introduction to telescopes. There are various types of telescopes depending on the wavelength we want
        to observe and the resolution that can be achieved. For example, optical and Radio waves can be observed from ground-based telescopes, whereas the same
        is not feasible for infrared, UV, and X-ray wavebands. To tackle that, we send the telescopes to specific points in higher atmosphere or space. Also,
        we have telescopes of different sizes and arrangements with different resolutions and use cases. For example, radio observations need a very large 
        aperture of the telescope, which is very difficult to make with a single disc antenna. For that array of small antennas is installed in a large open 
        area.

     <p class="post">The speaker takes everyone through the journey of the capabilities of different telescopes, mainly those with a size greater than 8 meters.
        To list a few:
        <ul class="post">
            <li><em>South African Large Telescope (SALT)</em>: This is the largest single optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. However, it has a major 
                drawback. It cannot be steered to change the angle of the telescope, hence limiting the observations to a relatively small ring of the sky.
            </li>
            <li><em>Very Large Telescope (VLT)</em>: With its set of four 8.2 meter telescopes, it is one of the most technologically advanced telescope 
                systems due to its ability to perform interferometry using its built-in MUSE equipment. In interferometry, we divide a wide field of view 
                (large fringe) into smaller slits and then record their interference fringes created by combining the light from multiple telescopes. For 
                example, our galaxy is quite wide apart and needs multiple slits to cover its boundaries.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="post">Next the speaker talks about Radio telescopes a little bit. Optical wavebands are limited, but Radio has a large bandpass. Also, radio 
        observations can be taken in the daytime, unlike optical. The most advanced telescope for Radio observation is <em>VLA</em> in US and <em>ALMA</em> in 
        Europe. ALMA is the costliest ground-based telescope to be built to date, with 66 radio antennas in operation. The <em>Five hundred meter Aperture 
        Spherical Telescope (FAST)</em> in Guizhou, China, is the world’s largest field-aperture telescope. It works in the radio band 70 MHz- 3.0 GHz. India 
        has its own telescopes for radio observation. The <em>Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT)</em> in Pune is the largest radio telescope in India. The
        main goal of this telescope was to observe the 21 cm line of the neutral Hydrogen. The USPs of this telescope are the 153 and 325 MHz frequencies, 
        which are critical in Radio astronomy.
    </p> 

    <p class="post">Other than optical and Radio telescopes, we also have UV and X-ray telescopes in space. The most popular globally is the 32 years old 
        <em>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</em>, which has made fundamental contributions to the field. India’s <em>AstroSat</em>, launched in 2015, can also 
        detect X-ray polarization, a unique attribute of this telescope. Now, modern-day astronomy is progressing from multi-wavelength to multi-messenger 
        observation. By multi-messenger observation, it is implied that we are also looking for messengers other than photons, like neutrinos, cosmic rays, 
        and gravitational waves.

        A few take-home points from this lecture:
        <ul class="post">
            <li>Telescopes have increased in size over time, and the trend will continue in the coming future.</li>
            <li>A vast number of telescopes are coming up both on Earth and in space.</li>
            <li>They continue to expand our knowledge further, probing the Universe closer and closer to the Big Bang.</li>
            <li>Multi-messenger astronomy is the new norm, as has been with GW detection recently.</li>
            <li>India is part of a handful of major projects like SKA, TMT, and GMRT, with a possibility of a 10-meter class telescope in the future.</li>
        </ul>
