        <p class="post">
            Coronal Holes are the darkest and least active regions in the solar corona as observed on the solar disk and above the solar limb. They are 
            associated with high-speed solar winds that are responsible for a fraction of geomagnetic storms on Earth. Thus naturally its detection is crucial 
            for predicting space weather. We will take a look at some popular detection methods and how Neural Networks can help us take the field forward.

    <h5>
        What are Coronal Holes?
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        Coronal Holes are regions in the solar Corona where the plasma is cooler and denser than the other parts. Coronal holes appear as dark areas in the 
        solar Corona in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray solar images. They appear dark because they are cooler, less dense regions than the 
        surrounding plasma and are regions of open (locally), unipolar magnetic fields.

    <h5>
        Signatures of Coronal Holes
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>If observed in EUV or Soft X-ray, the coronal holes appear as dark regions (darker than the surroundings).</li>
            <li>The magnetograms will appear to be predominantly unipolar since the magnetic field lines appear to be open locally.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>
        Importance of Coronal Holes
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>Coronal Holes are associated with open magnetic field lines that extend into the heliosphere. Thus, the ions and electrons are accelerated 
                through these lines creating high-speed winds, which are responsible for a fraction of geomagnetic storms on Earth.</li>
            <li>The boundaries of Coronal Holes might play a role in the origin of slow solar winds.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>
        A brief overview of a few existing methods
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>
                <h5>Simple Intensity Thresholding</h5>
                <p>A Histogram based method that uses intensity threshold and removes filaments using magnetograms. A single peak is observed in the absence 
                    of Coronal Holes, however, a double peak emerges in the Intensity histogram in the presence of coronal holes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>CHIMERA (Coronal Hole identification via multi-thermal emission recognition algorithm)</h5>
                <p>It analyses intensities in three bands (171 Å, 193 Å, and 211 Å) to segment pixels with similar properties together to a Coronal Hole. 
                    Coronal Holes have a typical temperature of 0.7 MK, which means they should produce peak emission in the 171 Å passband.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>
        Problems encountered while detecting Coronal Holes
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>Other features in the solar Corona, like filaments, Coronal dimming, etc., appear equally dark as Corona Holes.</li>
            <li>Due to the near-limb projection effects, the intensity-based segmentation techniques will perform worse as we go polewards. Also, brighter 
                structures will obscure the Coronal Holes as we move towards the pole.</li>
            <li>The shape, size, and location of Coronal Holes change over a few solar rotations and between solar maxima and solar minima.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>
        Tackling these problems using Neural Networks
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>Neural Networks are known to have better accuracy.</li>
            <li>There is less human intervention.</li>
            <li>The network can pick out large time-scale patterns.</li>
            <li>They are usually faster.</li>
            <li>We have a large dataset at hand.</li>
        </ol>
        We can also create catalogues for CMEs and Solar Winds using these ML techniques, which will help future researchers.
