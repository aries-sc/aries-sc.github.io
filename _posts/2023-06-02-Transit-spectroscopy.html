            The transit method has proven immensely valuable in detecting exoplanets but also holds great potential for characterizing their atmospheres. In 
            this discussion, I will explore the utilization of both low and high-resolution transit spectroscopic techniques, which are employed to examine the 
            atmospheres of exoplanets using ground-based facilities such as HCT/HFOSC, Gemini/GMOS, Keck/HIRES, VLT/ESPRESSO, HARPS, etc.

    <h5>
        What is Transit Method:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        The transit method is a popular method to detect and analyse the characteristics of many astronomical objects, like binary stars, exoplanets. Suppose 
        a far-away star has few planets. We can detect the variation of photon flux coming from the star with time using telescope detectors. It is called a 
        light curve. Now, when the planets of the star come in front of the star, in our FOV, the amount of flux coming from the star decreases, and therefore 
        the existence of the planets can be assumed from the light curve. The size of the orbit of the planets can be calculated from the time it takes to 
        orbit the star once, and the size of the planets can be obtained by noting the amount of dimming it has done in the light curve.

        Transit Spectroscopy:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        We can learn about the atmosphere of the exoplanet during transit. As the planet's atmosphere reabsorbs and scatters the photons coming from the star, 
        the transit depth (The amount of intensity dimming in the light curve of the star due to the planet) is wavelength dependent. In the UV and bluer part 
        of the optical the lines transit depth decreases with increasing wavelength due to Rayleigh scattering, whereas Na and K lines are visible in the 
        optical band and H<sub>2</sub>O and other molecular lines are visible in the NIR band.

    <h5>
        Low-Resolution Spectroscopy:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>A reference star of the same spectral type as the host star is chosen in the same science frame.</li>
            <li> Low-resolution spectroscopic observations are taken continuously covering transit and out of transit.</li>
            <li>The fluxes of the host star at each wavelength are normalised by dividing it by the fluxes of reference star.</li>
            <li>The cumulative relative flux of the host star in each wavelength bin is then plotted as a function of phase to obtain the wavelength dependent transit 
                depth.</li>
        </ol>

        Merits and Demerits of LR Spectroscopy:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>It is useful for initial study of exoplanets and for understanding possible atmospheric signatures.</li>
            <li>Smaller telescopes (e.g, 2 m) are also capable of doing it.</li>
            <li>Number of data points is less.</li>
            <li>Observation alone cannot provide a detailed information about the atmosphere of the exoplanet.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>
        High-Resolution Spectroscopy:
    </h5>

    <p class="post">
        <ol class="post">
            <li>High-resolution spectroscopic observations are taken continuously covering transit and out of transit.</li>
            <li>Stability of the wavelength solution throughout the observation is important.</li>
            <li>High Resolution Spectra is analysed to study individual spectral features of the exoplanet atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Residual planetary signal is obtained by subtracting individual in-transit spectra with master out of transit spectra.</li>
        </ol>
