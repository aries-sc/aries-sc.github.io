    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Gamma Ray Bursts</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most energetic and luminous events in the universe. These powerful explosions can 
    last from milliseconds to minutes, and they can be hundreds of times brighter than a typical supernova and a million trillion times brighter than the Sun.
    Despite their discovery decades ago, we still do not fully understand the origins and causes of GRBs. One of the main challenges in studying GRBs is their
    classification. To unravel this mystery, various classification schemes have been proposed based on different characteristics of the bursts, such as 
    duration, hardness, and spectral properties. Join me as we delve into this problem and explore the latest advancements in solving it</p>
