    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Fantastic Instruments and How to understand them!</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Instruments are the hidden figures of every world, especially astronomy and we need to give them the attention they 
        deserve! In this talk I will attempt to cover the basics of instruments, both ground and space based, used in astronomy all over the world and how 
        they give us the data we use for our research.</p>
