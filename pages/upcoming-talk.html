    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Observational aspects of Coronal Heating in the context of kink oscillations</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Coronal heating is a problem that has puzzled scientists for decades. One proposed mechanism for coronal heating is the 
        energy transfer in the solar corona by Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Several types of MHD waves can be observed in the solar corona, and kink 
        oscillations are a ubiquitous manifestation of largely transverse MHD waves in the solar corona. In this talk, I'll touch upon the historical and 
        introductory aspects of coronal heating, shedding light on the observational perspective. Furthermore, we'll explore the intriguing topic of kink 
        oscillations and their related heating phenomena within the context of the most recent and cutting-edge imaging instruments.</p>
