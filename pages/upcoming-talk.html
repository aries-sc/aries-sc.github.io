    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Transit Spectroscopy - A Tool to Probe the Exoplanet Atmosphere</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The transit method has proven immensely valuable in detecting exoplanets but also holds great potential for characterizing 
        their atmospheres. In this discussion, I will explore the utilization of both low and high-resolution transit spectroscopic techniques, which are 
        employed to examine the atmospheres of exoplanets using ground-based facilities such as HCT/HFOSC, Gemini/GMOS, Keck/HIRES, VLT/ESPRESSO, HARPS, etc.</p>
