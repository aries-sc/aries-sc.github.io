    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Active Galaxies: Most Powerful Objects in the Universe - An Overview</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Active galaxies are highly luminous astrophysical sources in the universe powered by “supermassive black holes” via processes known as “accretion”.
        They contain a highly bright, compact region at the galaxy’s center called “active galactic nuclei” (AGN). Their emission spreads over a wide range of
        frequencies through radio to γ-rays. Both thermal and non-thermal radiations from different components of AGN contribute to the total observed emission.
        They exhibit extreme variations ranging from all the time-scale from minutes to years across the electromagnetic band. These variations occur as flares
        or quiescent/low-activity states. Studying the cause for such physical properties of AGNs through multi-frequency data using ground and space-based
        observatories has been found to be one of the most effective ways in the past. Despite such studies in various wavebands, there are several questions
        for which answers are not fully understood. In this talk, the speaker will briefly introduce AGN and its current understanding status, along with the 
        scope of AGN research.</p>
