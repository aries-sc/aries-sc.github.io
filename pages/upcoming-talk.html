    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Exploring the power of Machine Learning and Big Data in Astrophysics with a Test case</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There has been a massive growth in the availability of Astrophysical data in recent years. This growth is going to 
        increase in the future with the advent of newer telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope now known as the Vera 
        Rubin Telescope, and the Dark energy survey Instrument DESI. This, combined with the existing telescopes, provides a plethora of opportunities to 
        employ ML to solve astrophysical problems. In this talk, I introduce ML in astrophysics and discuss a test case of classifying variable stars using 
        the K nearest neighbor technique in anticipation that the talk will encourage peers to explore astrophysical data sets and appreciate the power and 
        nuances related to algorithms and big data in astrophysics.</p>
