    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Scaling the Universe: A historical perspective</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Distance measurement has been at the forefront of astronomy. It is now understood that all the distances in the universe 
        are connected to each other through the 'cosmic ladder.' However, this discovery hasn't come easily. It involved numerous scientific expeditions and 
        campaigns from the 3rd century BCE to the late 20th century, often fraught with failures, rivalries, nobility, wars, a lost estate, a lost nose, and 
        even a murder mystery! In this talk, we will explore how several men and women, from Aristarchus of Samos to modern-day astronomers, undertook the 
        painstaking journey to scale the universe.
