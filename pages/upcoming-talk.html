    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Be stars: study of stellar gaseous discs</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Be stars are rapidly rotating massive B type stars surrounded by gaseous equatorial discs and exhibit emission lines of 
        different elements. Study of these emission features produce wealth of information about the disc geometry, kinematics and evolution. However, the 
        disc formation mechanism of Be stars remains unclear till date. I shall highlight the worldwide efforts going on presently to better understand these 
        exotic stars and the physics of their discs. The contribution of the lndian Be star community will also be discussed along with future scope</p>
