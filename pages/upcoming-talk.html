    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Importance of Giant Molecular Clouds in Cosmic Ray Astrophysics</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are massive, dense areas of gas and dust in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) that are essential 
        for creating stars and planets. These clouds also have a significant impact on cosmic ray (CR) astrophysics because of their potential to provide 
        insights into the origins and nature of these High Energy (HE) particles. The origin of CRs can be confirmed by detecting non-thermal HE gamma-ray and 
        neutrino emissions from the GMCs. Although both electrons and protons can produce HE gamma-rays through leptonic processes like Bremsstrahlung or 
        Inverse Compton and hadronic processes like p-p interactions, neutrinos can only be created by hadronic processes (CR interaction with the target ISM 
        material). Therefore, the detection of neutrinos is the key to revealing the CR sources. In the era of multi-messenger CR astrophysics, GMCs have 
        become more crucial to pinpoint possible sources and accelerators of HE CR. In the presentation, I will discuss the interaction between CRs and GMCs 
        using a combination of observational data, theoretical modelling, and Monte Carlo simulation.
