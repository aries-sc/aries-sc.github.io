    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Journey of light elements through the cosmos</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In this talk, we will discuss the journey of light elements through the cosmos. We will start with the Big Bang Nucleo-synthesis and discuss how some 
        light elements are currently distributed throughout our home Galaxy, the Milk Way. We will also discuss how information about such distributions helps in 
        understanding the formation and evolution histories of the Galaxy. Finally, will conclude the talk by giving a brief account of some of the unsolved issues 
        involving light elements.
