    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Mathematical Aspects and Caveats of Temporal Analysis of lightcurve</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the talk, I will briefly start with different behaviors that may appear in and the different samplings of the 
        lightcurves along with the issue to be wary of, while flux to magnitude conversion. The talk will be mainly oriented to periodic search in the 
        lightcurve. The two types of Fourier transforms along with the utility of one over the other will be discussed. I will present some real 
        lightcurves, their temporal analyses that are directly implicated to the topics covered and discuss various properties of a periodogram with the 
        dependence of their peak significance onto their normalizations. A brief disclosure of convolution and its versatility over binning will be 
        discussed as well and if time permits I will also go over Wavelet analysis and its superiority over periodograms.</p>
