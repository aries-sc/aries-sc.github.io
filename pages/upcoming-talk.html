    <h1 style="text-align: center;">A Curious Straight Ray</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Astrophysical jets are fascinating phenomena that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysical objects like active 
        galactic nuclei (AGNs), microquasars, neutron stars, young stellar objects (YSOs), and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). They are narrow, highly collimated 
        outflows of plasma that can extend over vast distances from the central object. Despite years of research and advances in observation and simulation 
        of these objects, the formation, collimation, and composition of these jets still remain as open questions. In this talk, I will give an overview 
        about our understanding of these enigmatic and fascinating objects.</p>
