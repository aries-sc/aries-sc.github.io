    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Black holes up close</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> We are organizing a Research Paper Discussion Session, where we will delve into the fascinating world of scientific 
        research and explore the insights presented in a selected research paper. This activity will be headed by our esteemed member, Vivek Kumar Jha, who 
        currently serves as a Project Associate(Scientific).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Paper Title</strong>: Black holes up close</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Authors</strong>: Ramesh Narayan and Eliot Quataert</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Abstract</strong> Black hole physics is a fundamental field that lies at the intersection of astrophysics, general relativity, and quantum 
        mechanics. Hence, discoveries in this domain can be appreciated regardless of one's area of expertise.  The recent images of the shadows of the black 
        holes in M87 and Sagittarius A have captured the public's imagination. These images represent a major breakthrough in our understanding of black holes 
        and their behavior. However, beyond popular science articles in newspapers, it is important for researchers to delve deeper into the significance of 
        this discovery. While many among us may have read the EHT papers detailing the experiment, it is also important to discuss the scientific impact of 
        this discovery. In this paper, Ramesh Narayan  and Eliot Quataert explore this very aspect.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Under Vivek's guidance, we will have an open dialogue about the research paper, its methodology, findings, and implications. It will be an excellent opportunity for everyone to share their perspectives, ask questions, and learn from one another's insights.

        To make the most of this session, I encourage you to read the research paper in advance. You may access it through the provided link: 
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05768-4">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05768-4</a>. Reading and reflecting on the 
        paper beforehand will enable us to have more meaningful discussions during the session.</p>
