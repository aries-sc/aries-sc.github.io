    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Coronal Holes and their Detection: A simple overview</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Coronal Holes are the darkest and least active regions in the solar corona as observed on the solar disk and above the 
        solar limb. They are associated with high-speed solar winds that are responsible for a fraction of geomagnetic storms on Earth. Thus naturally its 
        detection is crucial for predicting space weather. We will take a look at some popular detection methods and how Nueral Networks can help us take 
        the field forward.</p>
